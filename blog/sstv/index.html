<h1>SSTV</h1>

<!--
<p style="text-align: center">Slow Scan TV or (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-scan_television">SSTV</a>) is something that I've had some fun with. It's an analog signal that can be used in many settings. Below is an example of what the signal sounds like and an example image decoded from that same signal, line by line.</p>

Slow Scan TV aka 
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-scan_television">SSTV</a>) 
is an analog signal that can be used to send images via audio tones. 
Below is an example of what the signal sounds like and an image 
decoded from that same signal. The image is built line by line starting 
at the top of the image and going down to the bottom.

This method of picture transmission is used heavily in the ham radio community. 
The International Space Station and other man-made satellites are also known to 
take part in <strong>SSTV</strong> transmissions from time to time.

I got this image from ISS on 12/30/24 during a night pass over my house. ISS 
used the PD120 mode to generate the signal. The 120 means 120 seconds, it took 
that long to send/decode this image. The number at the end of most SSTV modes 
usually corresponds to how long it takes to send an image. The longer modes tend 
to have better quality, at the cost of taking more time to encode/decode. 
The picture of Cali was using the mode Robot36 and it took 36 seconds to send. 
There are even faster modes like Robot8 but again you sacrifice quality with faster 
speeds.
